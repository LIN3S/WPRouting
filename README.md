## Why?
Wordpress routing system is a magical awesome but dark system. For non developers this routing just "works" but,
when you need to customize this process is not very intuitive. In [LIN3S][1], we are proud PHP developers that like
[Symfony][2] ecosystem so, this library is a simple but powerful approach to **Symfony Routing component** for using
inside Wordpress project.

If you want to test it, we already have a functional Wordpress project that includes this library ready to use:
[Wordpress Standard Edition][3] :). However in the next sections of this README we are going to try to explain the all
use cases of this WP Routing.

## Installation
The recommended and the most suitable way to install is through [Composer][4]. Be sure that the tool is installed
